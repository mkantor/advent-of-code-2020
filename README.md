Solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I've started in TypeScript, but if I use other languages I'll create separate
subfolders for them.

Quality-wise I'm aiming for "good enough without a lot of time investment". I
will be thinking about efficiency, readability, and maintainability as I work
but probably won't go back to polish the code very much after I have a correct
answer. I'm mostly doing this for interview practice, and interviews come with
time constraints.

I'm allowing myself to do some basic manual pre-processing of inputs instead of
writing parsers for each of the raw text formats given by the website. I like
writing parsers, but in this case I think it's a distraction from the main
point of each problem.

I'm *not* allowing any dependencies, only use of the standard library.
